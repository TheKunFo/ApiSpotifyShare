# Back End

The backend serves as an API to handle requests from the frontend

Technologies and Techniques Used

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for backend development

- Express.js: Web framework to build RESTful APIs

- MongoDB: NoSQL database to store clothing and user data

- Mongoose: ODM library to interact with MongoDB easily

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For user authentication and session management

- ESLint and Prettier: Tools to maintain code quality and style consistency

- Async/Await and Promises: For efficient asynchronous request handling

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

`npm run lint` — to check code quality with ESLint
